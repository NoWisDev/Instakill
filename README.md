# Instakill
 A tweak and dylib to instantly kill apps when they enter the background!

Useful for when a specific app is taking up too much memory in the background. Just inject the latest dylib from releases along with the Orion dylib into your app of choice via Sideloadly or ESign, and you should be good to go!
